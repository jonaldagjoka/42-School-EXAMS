# 42 School Exams

Note that this repository will be updated frequenlty ,and is created to be used as a guide for the 42 Next Exams ,starting with C-Language and in the future continuing with python.

To run the C codes please use the command as written below:

```
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror name_of_file.c -o obj

```
It would be great if you run the programms by the terminal and not the build in run button :)
