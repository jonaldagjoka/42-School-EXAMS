# 42 School Exams

This repository will be updated frequently and is intended to be used as a guide for upcoming 42 exams, starting with C language and later expanding to Python.

Compilation Instructions

To compile the C programs, use the following command:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror name_of_file.c -o program
```
Running the Programs

Please run the programs from the terminal rather than using the built-in run button of an IDE :)
